Commenting
==========

If you have been included in the list of stakeholders who can comment on this documentation, you will have the ability to make comments and track the comments made by others and the Vivacity response to them.

PageProofer
-----------

Setting up
```````````

We are using PageProofer (www.pageproofer.com) to manage the comments.  You may have received an email inviting you to join PageProofer. Once you join up and log in, you will see a screen similar to this:

.. image:: _static/images/commenting/pageproofer_activate.png
   :height: 400 px
   :alt: Pageproofer activation page


Enter a password and click ``Activate`` to activate your account.

Once you've activated your account, you'll see a page like this:

.. image:: _static/images/commenting/pageproofer_dashboard.png
   :height: 300 px
   :alt: Pageproofer dashboard


This is the PageProofer dashboard. It shows the status of comments on the IMPRCM documentation site. If you click the title, you'll be taken to the site.

.. tip:: It may be worth bookmarking this dashboard page as it will give you a good place to start with commenting the documentation.  The link to the documentation site here will always work even if VRC have to move the site around during development.
		 
The commenting pen
````````````````````

Once you are logged in to PageProofer and you navigate to the IMPRCM documentation site, you will see something like this:

.. image:: _static/images/commenting/pageproofer_penicon.png
   :height: 400 px
   :alt: Pageproofer - documentation page with commenting pen

The pen icon in the bottom right of the page indicates that you can comment on this page. If you click it, the cursor becomes a cross and you are invited to double-click on a page element to leave a comment about it.

You will also see markers for any previous comments that have been left on this page.

If you double-click on an item, a dialog will open to allow you to enter a commment, like this:

.. image:: _static/images/commenting/pageproofer_addcomment.png

   :alt: Pageproofer comment capture dialog
   
You can attach photos or screenshots or other files to you comment if you wish; and you can change its priority from the default "Normal" to "Low" or "High".

Markers
~~~~~~~

Once you have created your comment, you will see that a marker is left on the screen for it, and the PageProofer toolbar shows a number in the circle:

.. image:: _static/images/commenting/pageproofer_withmarker.png

If you hover over the marker you will see a short description of the comment:

You can open the comment and add further comments at any time.

The Issue Process
-----------------

Comments that you make on the web pages are automatically recorded as issues on VRC's issue management tool in Github.  This means that they will be tracked and tackled using the same process as VRC use for any other project issues and code bugs.

Any comments made by VRC during work on the issue will automatically be added to the PageProofer comment as well and so will be visible to stakeholders.

The screenshot above shows how the comment looks in the Github issue management system, with a new response from VRC.

Notifications
