  Cross-industry RCM Project Process Map - Overview

:numref:`process_map_overview` shows the overall lifecycle of a Cross-industry RCM scheme, in terms of phases, gateways, workstreams and the main tasks to be carried out. 

It expands the overview map shown in :ref:`getting-started` and summarises the business process maps described in T1010-02 Appendix C2 [1]_ and T1010-03 Best Practice Guide [2]_. 


The elements of the process map are described briefly below. The :ref:`workstreams` and :ref:`frameworks` each have their own page in this documentation set.

Phases and Gateways
===================

a Cross-industry RCM project can be considered as having a sequence of phases. At the end of each phase, and sometimes part-way through it, are gateways at which decisions are made whether and how to proceed with the project.

.. _phase-investigation:

Investigation Phase
--------------------

This initial phase evaluates whether a Cross-industry RCM scheme is necessary and whether there is any chance of it being commercially and technically feasible. Outline work is done on the business need, the expected scope of the project, a business case and possible stakeholders and commercial arrangements.

.. _gateway_opportunity:

Gateway "Opportunity?"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As early as possible during the Investigation Phase, a decision needs to be taken based on the scoping and business case work done so far as to whether a case has emerged for using Cross-industry RCM, or could the business need be met another way?  If the answer is no, the scheme is abandoned.

If there is a Cross-industry RCM opportunity, work continues to identify technical options for sourcing, delivering, storing and using the Cross-industry RCM data. These options are costed in outline and the results used to inform the developing business case. Stakeholders and involved parties are identified and the basic elements of commercial / legal relationships with them included in the commercial options.


.. _gateway_feasible_scheme:

Gateway "Feasible Scheme?"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once a potentially-feasible scheme can be envisaged, the next point of decision is whether to proceed to define the scheme and move towards a formal agreement to implement it. This is the "Feasible Scheme" gateway.

If there is no technically / financially feasible scheme, the process is halted. If there is, work now proceeds to the Definition Phase.


.. _phase-definition:

Definition Phase
--------------------
In this phase, the proposed Cross-industry RCM scheme is worked up to a full set of commercial agreements with all the necessary schedules specifying the commercial, legal and technical elements of the scheme.


This involves compiling the framework documents which capture the business requirements and identify the data needs and the technical resources needed to support them, identify all the concerned stakeholders and capture their interests in contractual form. 

.. _frameworks:

Frameworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are shown in :numref:`pm_frameworks_overview` along with the context and need which influence them.

  Cross-industry RCM Project Framework Documents - Overview



These are the framework documents prepared. :numref:`pm_frameworks_overview` shows the relationships between them.

- The :ref:`information-framework`: the statement of information requirements, in terms of content and other relevant characteristics such as timeliness, completeness, accuracy, availability etc. 
- The :ref:`technical-framework`: the statement of technical requirements required to provide the information defined in the Information Framework.
- The :ref:`Business Case <model-the-business-case-for-a-potential-xircm-scheme>`: the justification for the scheme in business terms.
- The :ref:`Commercial Framework <commercial-guidance>`: a formal agreement between each of the parties.
- the :ref:`operational-framework`: the definition of how the scheme will be operated in service.

Guidance on preparing these documents is available:

- :ref:`commercial-guidance` gives general guidance on the commercial documentation
- :ref:`technical-guidance` describes T1010 requirements, best-practice recommendations and project experience on the technical aspects
- :ref:'business-case-tool' shows how to use the T1010 Business Case Toolkit to identify costs and benefits of the scheme as input to the business case.


.. _gateway_hot:

Gateway "Heads of Terms"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This gateway records the agreement of the :ref:`heads-of-terms` between the parties and thus the willingness to proceed with the project at least as far as a commercial contract.  If agreement cannot be reached at this stage, the alternatives are:
- conclude the project
- agree to work under a looser arrangement such as a non-disclosure agreement.

.. _gateway_contract:

Gateway "Contract"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This gateway records marks the signing of formal agreements between the parties to the scheme, upon which the scheme will be implemented.  The scheme now proceeds into the Implementation Phase. 

.. _phase-implementation:

Implementation Phase
--------------------
In this phase, the parties work together to bring the scheme into live operation. This involves procurement, development, testing and deployment of the data sharing solution, the change management necessary for it to be adopted as part of business processes, and planning for live operation.

.. _gateway_go_live:

Gateway "Go Live"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This gateway is a formal review of the readiness of the solution to pass into live operation. The solution must have passed acceptance tests and be deployable; all stakeholders must be ready for the process change that the solution will enable or require; service level agreements and operational guidelines must be in place.


.. _phase-operation:

Operation Phase
--------------------
This is the phase in which the scheme is operated. Tasks involve monitoring its technical performance, checking that the scheme is fulfilling the business goals it was set up for, and identifying future enhancements or modifications to the scheme, for example to meet new business needs or capitalise on new data sources.

.. _phase-extension:

Extension Phase
--------------------
enhancing the scheme to move to more fundamental integration with business processes or novel uses of the information captured.


.. _workstreams:

Workstreams
===================

Workstreams represent sequences of activities carried out by stakeholders with a particular interest in aspects of delivering the project. The workstreams are associated with particular scheme roles:
- Sponsor: business representative whose work is intended to benefit

.. _workstream_sponsor:

Sponsor Workstream
--------------------
Ensuring that the scheme addresses genuine business needs. Ensuring the scheme and its timetable and risks are managed in a proper business change framework.  Identifying, engaging and managing parties who need to interact with the scheme or who are otherwise involved.

See :ref:`act-as-sponsor-for-an-xircm-scheme` for full details of the role of the scheme sponsor.

.. _workstream_commercial:

Commercial / Legal Workstream
----------------------------------
Evaluating the costs and benefits of the scheme. Tackling the commercial and legal arrangements between parties to the scheme. Drawing up the contractual documents: Heads of Terms and Contract.

See :ref:`strike-a-commercial-agreement-for-an-xircm-scheme` for full details of the role of the scheme commercial/legal teams.


.. _workstream_technical:

Technical Workstream
---------------------
Managing the interchange of data, ensuring relevant standards and guidelines are respected. 

See :ref:`set-up-technical-aspects-of-an-xircm-scheme` for more on the technical workstream.


.. _workstream_operational:

Operational Workstream
--------------------------
Running the scheme in live operation. 

See :ref:`operate-an-xircm-scheme` for more on the operational workstream.
