Cross-industry RCMSG First-phase work
--------------------------------------
These documents are the results of the first phase of work sponsored by the :term:`XIRCMSG`. They set the basic requirements and defined the industry constraints that the :term:`T1010` work responded to.

- `T844 Mapping current remote condition monitoring activities to the system reliability framework <\_static\XIRCMSG\T844\_rpt\_final1.pdf>`_ (T844). T844 investigated a large number of then-current RCM activities and worked out what impact improved cross-industry working would have on them. It made a number of recommendations about future work that should be done to support this goal.
- `T857 06 Overview <\_static\Cross-industry RCMSG\T857-06-rpt1.pdf>`_ (T857).

.. _`rail-tech-strategy`:

The Rail Technical Strategy 2012
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Rail Technical Strategy was produced by the Technical Strategy Leadership Group (TSLG) to set out a 30-year vision of a transformed railway that will continue to satisfy its customers. To do that while meeting goals of increased capacity, reduced cost and lower carbon consumption it will need to *"remove barriers and find more innovative and cost-effective ways to increase capacity and improve performance"* [#]_.

The :term:`RTS` sets out a strategy to achieve this which has six workstreams. :term:`XIRCM` is a key part of three of them:

- **Infrastructure**. The vision is for *"world-class asset management using train-borne inspection to provide accurate, timely information for condition-based intervention"* [#]_ using  *"... remote condition monitoring ... across the railway to save significant costs and improve performance. Recommendations include ... integrate existing and isolated RCM models and practices ... use infrastructure fixed points to monitor rolling stock and use rolling stock to monitor fixed infrastructure"* [#]_. 
- **Rolling Stock**. The vision is for rolling stock's whole-life costs to be reduced through reliability improvement and better interfaces with infrastructure.  Among the objectives are *"a whole-system approach which ... improves condition monitoring..."* [#]_. Enabling these objectives will be *"a cross-industry commercial and technical framework ... to allow asset condition data to be shared and exploited across all infrastructure and rolling stock asset types"* [#]_  and *"... Cross-interface RCM - trains monitor infrastructure and vice-versa"* [#]_.
- **Information**. The vision is for much more effective use of the industry's data, specifically: *"Agreed architectural standards ... support connectivity, improve the capability to share the information resources and facilitate a whole-system approach"* [#]_.  Among the strategic goals are *"A suite of common and open standards"* and *"A common information framework"* [#]_.  Cross-industry RCM specifically needs these types of IT.


The :term:`RTS` identifies three common foundations which link across the workstreams: a whole-system approach, innovation and people. Of these:

- the **whole system approach** directly impacts Cross-industry RCM. The report explicitly mentions the Cross-industry RCM Strategy Group (:term:`XIRCMSG`) (see :ref:`xircmsg` below) and its work; and in the vision for the future it includes *"Improved remote asset monitoring including RCM ... increases the reliability of infrastructure and rolling stock"* [#]_. Part of the strategy is the development of *"Aligned asset management plans"* [#]_ to bring coherence across all industry parties.
- **innovation** is necessary for Cross-industry RCM to flourish: it relies on novel equipment, processes and commercial structures. The strategy for innovation includes the key goal of *"commercial models to allow intellectual property (IP) to be accessed, shared and evolved for cross-industry benefits"*. These models should, among other things, *"support a quicker development cycle ...[to] ... allow products and services to enter the market more quickly and provide opportunities for wider exploitation throughout the rail industry and beyond"* [#]_.
