  Cross-industry RCM Project Framework Documents - Overview

The Technical Framework defines the various technical aspects of the RCM data interchange.

:numref:`tf_frameworks_overview` shows how the Technical Framework fits in with the other framework documentation.

- it is informed by the :ref:`information-framework` which defines what data need to be exchanged and the characteristics it needs to have to be useful
- it informs the :ref:`Commercial Framework <commercial-guidance>` whose schedules define the technical deliverables (Schedule 2) and service level agreements (Schedule 6)
- it inputs costs, timescales and risks to the :ref:`Business Case <model-the-business-case-for-a-potential-xircm-scheme>`
- it provides the basis for the :ref:`operational-framework`.

It is a product of the :ref:`set-up-technical-aspects-of-an-xircm-scheme` workstream which is part of the overall process roadmap described in :ref:`scheme-process`.

The Technical Framework defines the *"how"* element of the scheme, of which the *"what"* element has been set out in the :ref:`information-framework`.

The framework should have sections that cover the following aspects:

- :ref:`tf-data`: the technical definition of the contents of the data flows
- :ref:`tf-sizing`: calculations of data volumes and rates
- :ref:`tf-interfaces`: definitions of the inbound and outbound interfaces of the solution and, where relevant, internal interfaces between components
- :ref:`tf-architecture`: specification of the solution architecture
- :ref:`tf-equipment`: specification of the data-gathering equipment
- :ref:`tf-data-processing`: specification of the data processing pipeline
- :ref:`tf-downstream`: specification of the end-user components of the scheme: interactions with human data users or their IT systems
- :ref:`tf-security`: cyber-security, data integrity, encryption, physical security, backup and disaster recovery
- :ref:`tf-access`: access control, authentication and authorisation 
- :ref:`tf-management`: management of the solution over time: responsibilities for support, maintenance, upgrade; version management; extension and enhancment.

The framework document should be structured and formatted so that sections from it can be used directly as schedules and appendices to commercial agreements and as specifications for procurement and testing.
