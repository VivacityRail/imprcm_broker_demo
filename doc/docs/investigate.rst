Investigate a Cross-industry RCM opportunity

This page contains all the guidance, or links to guidance, that may be needed by someone investigating a potential Cross Industry Remote Condition Monitoring scheme.

Planning a potential XI RCM scheme
===================================

This area explains the lifecycle and tasks involved in getting an XI RCM scheme under way. 

The investigation phase evaluates whether a potential Cross-Industry RCM scheme is viable, via the gateways of Opportunity and Feasibility. Outline work should be carried out on business requirements, expected scope, a business case and possible stakeholders and commercial arrangements.

Investigation Phases
---------------------

Gateway "Opportunity?"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the first instance, the sponsor must be able to demonstrate that the scheme is necessary. This can be based on initial business case and scoping work, and must demonstrate that there is a case for using Cross-Industry RCM that could not be met by existing capabilities or a simpler solution than cross industry monitoring. A decision then needs to be taken on whether the scheme investigation should proceed, or be abandoned.    


Gateway "Feasible Scheme?"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Secondly, it must be demonstrated that the proposed scheme is likely to be commercially or technically feasible. Work continues to identify technical options for sourcing, delivering, storing and using the Cross-industry RCM data. These options are costed in outline and the results used to inform the developing business case. Stakeholders and involved parties are identified and the basic elements of commercial / legal relationships with them included in the commercial options.

Once a potentially-feasible scheme can be envisaged, a decision is made as to whether to proceed to define the scheme and move towards a formal agreement to implement it.  If there is no technically / financially feasible scheme, the process is halted. If there is, work now proceeds to the Definition Phase.



Guidance
---------

`The T1010 03 Good Practice Guide <\_static/T1010/T1010-03/A\_good\_practice\_guide\_for\_the\_introduction\_of\_cross\_industry\_RCM.pdf>`_ provides a brief explanation of the expected lifecycle of an RCM project. This is a useful introduction to what tasks are involved in an RCM scheme, and what sort of things will need to be considered. The guide is structured around the project stages of planning, implementation and operation.


More detailed,  structured and role-based guidance for planning an XI RCM scheme is available in the :ref:`Process page and diagram<scheme-process>`, around which this suite of guidance is structured.
