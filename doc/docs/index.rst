Welcome to the Rail Cross Industry Remote Condition Monitoring (XIRCM) resource: a guide to using the toolkit developed in RSSB's research project :term:`T1010`. Here you will find guidance, reference material, tips, sample template documents and best-practice notes gained from applying this toolkit to an actual Cross-industry RCM scheme (:ref:`intro-IMPRCM`).

Getting Started
============================
If you are new to Cross-industry RCM, see the :ref:`introduction-to-xircm` or read these pages which describe the workstreams associated with a Cross-industry RCM scheme:

.. include:: includes/front_page_diagram_level1_user_stories.txt

- :ref:`investigate-an-xircm-opportunity`: look at a possible XIRCM scheme to see if there is an opportunity worth pursuing
- :ref:`act-as-sponsor-for-an-xircm-scheme`: drive the scheme from a business perspective
- :ref:`model-the-business-case-for-a-potential-xircm-scheme`: estimate a business case and distribution of cost / benefit between stakeholders

- The life-cycle of a Cross-industry RCM scheme: :ref:`scheme-process`
- The business view of the data being interchanged and how to ensure it is fit for purpose: :ref:`information-framework`
- The commercial framework and contractual / legal concerns: :ref:`commercial-guidance`
- The business case tool: :ref:`business-case-tool`
- The technical framework: :ref:`technical-framework`

The T1010 toolkit
===================
This guidance is based around the work done in RSSB's research project :term:`T1010` which set up a toolkit of guidance for XIRCM schemes. See:

- :ref:`intro-t1010` for an introduction into the research project: its purpose, structure and output
- :ref:`t1010-docs` for more detail on the documentation produced by the four workstreams: commercial, technical, business case and standards.

Reference
============
Background, source and reference material can be looked up in :ref:`reference`.

There is a :ref:`glossary`.
